  abstract = {SWI-Prolog is neither a commercial Prolog system nor a purely 
academic
enterprise, but increasingly a community project. The core system has
been shaped to its current form while being used as a tool for building
research prototypes, primarily for knowledge-intensive and
interactive systems. Community contributions have added
several interfaces and the constraint (CLP) libraries. Commercial
involvement has created the initial garbage collector, added several
interfaces and two development tools: PlDoc (a literate programming
documentation system) and PlUnit (a unit testing environment).

In this article we present SWI-Prolog as an integrating tool, supporting
a wide range of ideas developed in the Prolog community and acting as
glue between foreign resources. This article itself is the
glue between technical articles on SWI-Prolog, providing context and
experience in applying them over a longer period.}

cplint is a suite of programs for reasoning and learning with Probabilistic 
Logic Programming languages that follow the distribution semantics.
In this paper we describe how we have extended cplint to perform causal 
reasoning.
In particular, we consider Pearl's do calculus for models where all
the variables are measured.
The two cplint  modules for inference, PITA and MCINTYRE, have been extended 
for computing the effect of actions/interventions on these models.
We also executed experiments comparing exact and approximate inference with
conditional and causal queries, showing that causal inference is often cheaper 
than conditional inference.

  abstract = {
\texttt{cplint} on SWISH is a web application that allows users to
perform reasoning tasks on probabilistic logic programs.
Both inference and learning systems can be performed: conditional probabilities 
with exact,
rejection sampling and Metropolis-Hasting methods. Moreover, the system now 
allows hybrid programs,
i.e., programs where some of the random variables are continuous. To perform 
inference on such programs likelihood weighting and particle filtering are 
used. \texttt{cplint} on SWISH is also able to sample goals' arguments and
to graph the results. This paper reports on advances and new features
of \texttt{cplint} on SWISH, including the capability of drawing the
binary decision diagrams created during the inference processes.
